[s1; U`+`+ Mac OS installation&]
[s3; U`+`+ for POSIX (OpenBSD, FreeBSD) comes as single sandboxed 
archive. After downloading, you need to unpack this archive to 
suitable location with&]
[ {{10000G1@7 [s4; tar xf upp`-posix`-14411.tar.xz]}}&]
[s3; (replace 14411 with the revision you have downloaded). Of course, 
you can use your desktop environment desktop GUI utility as well.&]
[s3; U`+`+ requires C`+`+ toolchain to build applications. You can 
find a description how to install this toolchain e.g. [^http`:`/`/osxdaily`.com`/2014`/02`/12`/install`-command`-line`-tools`-mac`-os`-x`/^ h
ere].&]
[s3; Some other tools and libraries can be installed with [^https`:`/`/brew`.sh`/^ home
brew]. Following packages are recommended (as in they might be 
required in certain contexts):&]
[s3;l128;i150;O0;%- gdb&]
[s3;l128;i150;O0;%- openssl&]
[s3;l128;i150;O0;%- libssh2&]
[s3; As long as you keep [*/ theide ](or [*/ umk]) just in the original 
directory, nothing will be written outside of it `- its `"sandboxed`". 
If you get bored with U`+`+ and need to clean the space, simply 
delete the `"upp`" folder.&]
[s3; If you move theide e.g. to [/ `~/bin], it will start to write 
things to[/  `~/.config ]and [/ `~/.cache].&]
