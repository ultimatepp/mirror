Known Issues
------------

1) LaunchWebBrowser function doesn't work, at the moment.

  Hopefully, this is a temporary regression.
  Maybe it should be handled generally for VirtualGUi-based stuff, using a callback?

2) uppsrc contains various proprocessor definitons for Turtle.

  They are obsolete now and better be removed. (VIRTUALGUI is sufficient)

3) The VirtualGui-based Turtle package inherits the problems of the old Turtle package.

  One such major problem is that on windows platform, closing the remote app throws an 
  exception on the server side. This requires further investigation.
